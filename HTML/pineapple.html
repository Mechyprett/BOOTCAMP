      <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>pineapple</strong> [2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical
        plant with an edible fruit and the most economically significant plant
        in the family
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromeliaceae">Bromeliaceae</a> .
        [4] The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been
        cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to
        Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of
        luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in
        greenhouses and many tropical pl<sub>a</sub>ntations. Further, it is the
        third most important tropical fruit in world production. In the 20th
        century, Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, especially for
        the US; however, by 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines
        accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of
        pineapples<sub>[5]</sub>.

        <h2>Botany &lt; Me &gt; 5</h2>
        <p>
          The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5 m
          (3.3 to 4.9 ft) tall, although sometimes it can be taller. In
          appearance, the plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy
          leaves. When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200
          flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. Once
          it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to
          create a multiple fruit. After the first fruit is produced, side
          shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the
          leaf axils of the main stem. These may be removed for propagation, or
          left to produce additional fruits on the original plant.[6]
          Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated. It
          has 30 or more long, narrow, fleshy, trough-shaped leaves with sharp
          spines along the margins that are 30 to 100 cm (1.0 to 3.3 ft) long,
          surrounding a thick stem. In the first year of growth, the axis
          lengthens and thickens, bearing numerous leaves in close spirals.
          After 12 to 20 months, the stem grows into a spike-like inflorescence
          up to 15 cm (6 in) long with over 100 spirally arranged, trimerous
          flowers, each subtended by a bract.

      <h2>P<sub>o</sub>lli<sup>n</sup>ation</h2>
      <p>
        n the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds.[2][11]
        Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats.[12]
        Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality,
        pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for
        breeding.[2] In Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned
        industrially throughout the 20th century,[13] importation of
        hummingbirds was prohibited.[14]
